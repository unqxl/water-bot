# Water - Discord Bot

<strong>Welcome! Water - one of the best Discord Bots in terms of functionality.</strong>

<strong>
This bot includes a lot of useful functions, many of which I think can help you when setting up the server, here are a few of them:

1. Moderation - Bot can perform standard moderation (kick/ban/timeout). The list of moderation commands will be added to over time.
2. Music - The bot can play songs directly from YouTube. The bot always tries to play the songs in the best quality.
3. Customization - The bot has quite good customization, which you can play around with.
4. Twitch Notifications - A completely new system in the bot! This system checks Twitch streamers for the presence of a stream, and if there is one, it sends a notification to the preset channel.
5. Convenience - The bot was made on Slash Commands, which are easy to use. If you want, you can use the command "/other help" to familiarize yourself with the categories of commands.
   </strong>
